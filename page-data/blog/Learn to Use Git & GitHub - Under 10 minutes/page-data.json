You can go back in history all the way to your first <code class=\"language-text\">commit</code> and see the changes you’ve made to your files.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This is as close as you can get to a time machine - but only for your files and folders.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Forking and Cloning a remote repository</h3>\n<p>Before you start working with GitHub, you need to have an account. <a href=\"https://github.com/join\">Sign up</a> for GitHub and come back here.\nNow, go to this link and follow these steps to install Git in your computer:\n<a href=\"https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git\">Click Here</a></p>\n<p>If you are using Linux, you could use your package manager to install git directly.</p>\n<p>To check if you are done installing Git in your local computer, type the following in your command prompt/terminal:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"sh\"><pre class=\"language-sh\"><code class=\"language-sh\">git --version</code></pre></div>\n<p>If you did everything correctly, you will be prompted with the version of Git\nyour are running. If not, click the link mentioned above and install it correctly.</p>\n<p>After you are done with Installing Git, you need to clone this repository.\nFor that, follow these steps:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Click on the green Code button you see and you will get a drop down and copy the specified link.</li>\n<li>Now, open up your command prompt/terminal and execute the following:</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"sh\"><pre class=\"language-sh\"><code class=\"language-sh\">git clone https://github.com/hemanth-kotagiri/practice-git.git</code></pre></div>\n<ul>\n<li>The repository is now cloned in your <a href=\"https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/c/currentd.htm\">current working directory</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>With this, you now have a local copy of the repository.</p>\n<h3>Adding the upstream repository to your local development environment</h3>\n<p>It is essential to add the upstream(a fancy way to refer to the original repository that you have cloned) to your local copy.\nTo do this, follow these steps:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Make sure that you are in the directory of the cloned repository.</li>\n<li>Type the following command:</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"sh\"><pre class=\"language-sh\"><code class=\"language-sh\">git remote add upstream https://github.com/hemanth-kotagiri/practice-git.git</code></pre></div>\n<ul>\n<li>Now, the upstream repository will be added to your local development environment.</li>\n<li>To check the available remote(s) you have, type the following:</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"sh\"><pre class=\"language-sh\"><code class=\"language-sh\">git remote -v</code></pre></div>\n<ul>\n<li>You will get the following as the output:</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">origin\thttps://github.com/{YOUR-GITHUB-ID}/practice-git.git (fetch)\norigin\thttps://github.com/{YOUR-GITHUB-ID}/practice-git.git (push)\nupstream\thttps://github.com/hemanth-kotagiri/practice-git.git (fetch)\nupstream\thttps://github.com/hemanth-kotagiri/practice-git.git (push)</code></pre></div>\n<p>You are now ready to go for the next step, that is to creating a new branch.</p>\n<h3>Creating and working with branches</h3>\n<p>Branches are, literally just branches to your workflow. You can have multiple\nbranches for your repository where each branch can have its own name and\npossibly, have different code from the main/master branch.\nThe idea of branches is to move away from the main/master branch and tinker\naround and work on new ideas/implementations and use that branch to reference\nfor raising PRs and <code class=\"language-text\">merging</code> the new changes/implementations to the main/master branch.\nFollow these steps on creating a new branch and check-out (A fancy term to say\nactivate) the same.\nTo learn more about branches, head over to the <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-branches\">official documentation</a>.</p>\n<p>Assuming that you are in the same working directory of the cloned repository.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Type the following in your command prompt:</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"sh\"><pre class=\"language-sh\"><code class=\"language-sh\">git branch feat-0</code></pre></div>\n<ul>\n<li>Here, <code class=\"language-text\">feat-0</code> is the name of the branch you have just created.</li>\n<li>To see all the branches you have:</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"sh\"><pre class=\"language-sh\"><code class=\"language-sh\">git branch -a</code></pre></div>\n<ul>\n<li>Now, to activate that branch, type the following command:</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"sh\"><pre class=\"language-sh\"><code class=\"language-sh\">git checkout feat-0</code></pre></div>\n<ul>\n<li>You will now be prompted that you have successfully changed your branch to <code class=\"language-text\">feat-0</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Understanding project development and contribution work flows</h3>\n<p>Q. Why did we create a new branch, why not just work on the master branch?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It is always a good practice to modularize the features/implementations that you are working on so that they can be addressed individually by peers who are working with you on the same project.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You as a contributor to any Open Source project are required to follow a set of\ncontribution guidelines. And creating a branch, and raising PRs using it is\nabsolutely essential - Which we are covering here.\nUsually, for any project, these are the steps taken to add new features/code into a repository.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Developers will maintain a fork of the upstream repository in their account.</li>\n<li>They then create a new branch with meaningful name.</li>\n<li>Make the changes locally by adding new code/implementations.</li>\n<li>Then, they commit their changes with a meaningful message and push it to their remote origin.</li>\n<li>After that, the developer will go about creating a new Pull Request to the upstream repository.</li>\n<li>Maintainers from the upstream repository will be notified and the changes will be reviewed and accepted/rejected.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You don’t have to worry about the last step!</p>\n<h3>Learning to use basic git commands such as: <code class=\"language-text\">commit</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">add</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">push</code> &#x26; <code class=\"language-text\">pull</code></h3>\n<p>These are the four basic commands that you need to be familiar with.\nLet us learn these four commands in the fun way. Follow these steps:</p>\n<p>Remember we have added an upstream repository? Now, it’s time to synchronize that repository with your local copy using the <code class=\"language-text\">pull</code> command.</p>\n<h4>Pull</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Type the following in your command prompt/terminal and make sure you’re in the repository directory</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"sh\"><pre class=\"language-sh\"><code class=\"language-sh\">git pull upstream master</code></pre></div>\n<p>Q. What does the above command do?</p>\n<p>A. It will <code class=\"language-text\">pull</code> the changes/code/implementations of the <code class=\"language-text\">upstream</code>(which is the original repository that you have forked) <code class=\"language-text\">master</code> branch into your local copy.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Now copy your repository URL and type the following command:</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"sh\"><pre class=\"language-sh\"><code class=\"language-sh\">git remote add origin {YOUR-REPOSITORY-URL}</code></pre></div>\n<p>The above will create origin, if at all it doesn’t exist.\nIn this way, you will pull changes from remote repository, either from the upstream or from your origin.\nIn the case of origin, you would type: <code class=\"language-text\">git pull origin master</code></p>\n<h4>Add &#x26; Commit</h4>\n<p>You now have all the changes in the upstream repository synchronized with your local copy of the same.\nNow, you can simply create a file in the repository and track it’s changes.\nFollow these:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create a new folder in the directory with your name.</li>\n<li>Change directory into that folder that you have just created.</li>\n<li>Now, it’s your turn to track any file that you wish to. Be it a file consisting of a poem, story, quote, or more technically - Code.</li>\n<li>Create a new file and write anything within it and make sure, it’s saved in the folder that you have created.</li>\n<li>You are now ready for your first commit.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Understanding the Staging Area</h4>\n<p>When you type the following in the command prompt/terminal:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"sh\"><pre class=\"language-sh\"><code class=\"language-sh\">git status</code></pre></div>\n<p>You will be prompted that you have untracked file(s). This is where you move it to the staging area, that is - They are ready to be committed.</p>\n<p>Use the <code class=\"language-text\">add</code> command to add particular file(s) to track by the following command:\nIf you have named the new file as <code class=\"language-text\">poem.txt</code>:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"sh\"><pre class=\"language-sh\"><code class=\"language-sh\">git add poem.txt</code></pre></div>\n<p>Now, if you type this: <code class=\"language-text\">git status</code>, you will see that the files are ready to\nbe committed. Type the following:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"sh\"><pre class=\"language-sh\"><code class=\"language-sh\">git commit -m &quot;{MESSAGE}&quot;</code></pre></div>\n<p>Use the above command to commit the changes with a message which vaguely describes your changes.</p>\n<h4>Push</h4>\n<p>Now, type the following to finally push your changes to your remote\nbranch</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"sh\"><pre class=\"language-sh\"><code class=\"language-sh\">git push -u origin feat-0</code></pre></div>\n<p>With this, you have now pushed your new file successfully. To see the changes, head over to your repository in GitHub\nand you will see that there’s a new branch with new files.</p>\n<h3>Creating a Pull Request</h3>\n<p>To create a pull request, click on the “Create Pull Request” button that you are prompted when you visit your repository in GitHub.\nYou will now have the ability to add a Title and Description that you can write in Markdown, or plain text also works.\nAfter you are done explaining the changes, click on the Create Button and you are done!</p>\n<p>Now, the maintainers of the repository will be notified regarding your PR and they would review it!</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>For Precious, with Patience.</p>\n</blockquote>","frontmatter":{"title":"Learn to Use Git and GitHub","date":"September 01, 2021","description":"No Bullshit guide to learn Git"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/Learn to Use Git & GitHub - Under 10 minutes/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/Machine Learning - Why, and How/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Machine Learning | Why, and How?"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/Introduction to Neural Networks/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Introduction to Neural Networks"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["63159454"]}

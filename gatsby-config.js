    about: `Working as a Lead Technical Architect for a full stack web
    developement team, guiding and delivering end-to-end, highly performant,
    scalable web solutions. Alongside this, I also freelance delivering
    high-quality data-driven solutions for challenging problems such as image
    classification, regression analysis in the field of Machine Learning and
    Deep Learning. I love working on mobile-application development projects as
    well. In my fair time, I tend to ponder upon the universe, existence,
    consciousness, science, psychology, philosophy, physics, mathematics, and
    learn literally anything that crosses my mind. I love learning!`,

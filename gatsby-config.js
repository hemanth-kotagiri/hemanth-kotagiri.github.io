    about: `A freelancer delivering high-quality data-driven
    solutions for challenging problems such as image classification, regression
    analysis in the field of Machine Learning and Deep Learning. I love working on
    web-development and mobile-application development projects as well. In my
    fair time, I tend to ponder upon the universe, existence, consciousness,
    science, psychology, philosophy, physics, mathematics, and learn literally
    anything that crosses my mind.  Yes, an aspiring polymath.`,
